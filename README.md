# alarm_clock_coding_ninjas
This is a simple alarm clock project implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Here you can see the current time and set the multiple alarms as well. You can check or uncheck the alarms based on your requirement and delete the alarms that are no longer required.
You can replace the alarm sound by replacing the 'alarm.mp3' file with your desired sound file but make sure to rename the file name as given (alarm.mp3).
You can stop the ringing alarm by using the switch button and delet the alarm by using the bin icon.
